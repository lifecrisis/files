Summarize the changes in 50 characters or less

A summary line should be written in the imperative mood.  This style
will define the commit as an action that was applied to the code.
It also matches the style of commit messages that are generated
automatically by, for example, the "git revert" command.  Do NOT
terminate your summary line with a period.  Always capitalize the
first character in your summary line.

A more detailed explanation may follow the summary line, if
necessary.  Wrap the message text at 68 characters.  Note that the
blank line separating the summary line from the message body is
required (unless the message body is omitted entirely).  Fully
explain the "why" of this change.  Is there anything special that
readers should note?  Say it right now!

Paragraphs are separated, of course, by single blank lines.

  - Bulleted lists are okay, too.
  - Typically, a hyphen or an asterisk is the bullet, followed by
    a single space.
  - Use hanging indentation, as in the above point.
  - The list as a whole is indented by two spaces.
  - Numbered lists are formatted in the same manner.

After you have finished explaining "what" and "why" and establishing
the context for your commit, you may end by listing the ID numbers
of tickets or issues that this commit resolves or references.
